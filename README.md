# Simple Game

This is a simple game implemented with just the core MonoGame Desktop GL framework. 

The ball can be dragged around with the left mouse button, whereas holding down the right mouse button anywhere on the screen will cause the ball to travel to the target location.

Some basic physics is implemented to make interacting with the ball more interesting.
